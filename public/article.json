But at various moments of your routine, you pause and take a good look at your surroundings.The scenes of your everyday life. The blur of this all-too-familiar film.And you can’t help but to wonder…If there is more to it all.For some reason — this country, this city, this neighborhood, this particular street — is the place you are living a majority of your life in.And it is this thought that allows a daydream to seep in. You start thinking of all the other places you could be in this world.",

In 2017, officials declared a “garbage emergency” across a six-kilometer stretch of Bali’s coast. At the peak of the clean-up, hundreds of cleaners removed 100 tons of debris from the beaches each day.The cause? Too many tourists — who just keep coming. This year, the Indonesian tourism ministry hopes Bali attracts 7 million foreign tourists, to an island of only 4 million",

He continued, “When I am on my death bed, I want to look back at my life, and have all theseries. I want them to be full and different every single day.” I thought about this. Then I thought about my childhood. It turns out that I rode the bus to school nearly 200 days a year for more than 10 years. That’s 2,000 days. I don’t remember most of those days.
